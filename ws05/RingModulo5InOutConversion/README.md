In addition to demonstrating operator overloading using Boost.operators shorthand
this class also demonstrates a non-explicit conversion constructor and type conversion operator.

*Note*: normally such conversion operators should be explicit to avoid automatic compiler conversions 
in mixed expressions and resulting ambiguities.
