This (very bad!) example code demonstrates the different overload resolutions 
for rvalues and lvalues. It was inspired by Olve Maudal's C++ Pub Quiz.

_**Don't do this at home, it is exposition only code, not to be used outside this example.**_

You can use Templator (Template Information View) to visualize the respective overloads selected.
